        <p>	In this course designed for English majors in the Professional Writing Option, students will focus on the ways in which scientific, technical, and professional communication influence, and are influenced by, public discourse. Drawing on strategies of rhetorical criticism, students will gain an understanding of the persuasive value of style, arrangement, and delivery by investigating their professional roles in helping to structure public debate.</p>

        <h2>My Experience in the Course</h2>
        <p>In this course, I have learned what crisis communication is and the importance of it. Any time there is a crisis, whether a physical or technological disaster, it affects an entire community. Communication is one of the most critical things people need during that time. Without communication, there is chaos and misunderstanding. We have analyzed disasters such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill in which the communication response was not effective versus the British Petroleum oil spill in which communication was prompt, reassuring, and efficient. Our final project for this course is a conference paper relating to a topic within disaster studies/crisis communication. We are now researching and deciding on topics.  </p>
