        <h2>My Experience in the Course</h2>
        <p>In this course, I am learning how to effectively write grant proposals. While we have not started any writing yet, we are focusing on what is arguably the most important: the why. Establishing who you are and your mission and then finding a grant that aligns with your goals is just as important as the actual writing. Our final project is to research a grant and prepare a proposal for that grant. We are now researching grants and organizations to decide what to apply for.  </p>
