        <h2>My Experience in the Course</h2>
        <p>In this course, I am learning how to create digital content from structuring a website’s code using HTML to writing the website’s content to finally designing the website itself. We learned the basics of HTML and how to use AI to help us structure our website. I have skills from previous courses that help me to write content, but creating a website is totally new to me. I am enjoying learning these new skills and our future projects will build on that as we create more comprehensive websites.</p>
