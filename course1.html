        <h2>My Experience in the Course</h2>
        <p>In this course, I am learning what it is like to work for a small press publishing company and the process of publishing a book. We have gotten to look over ARCs (advanced review copies) to see how books look before being published. We had the founder of Noemi Press present to our class about working for a press and answer any questions. We will produce materials to promote two books being published soon including press releases and teaching guides.  </p>
